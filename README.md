# pAequorDNA
Creating a function which returns an object (an organism called "Pila Aequor"). The function's objective is to be able to mutate its DNA sequence, finding the common DNA percentage between two different organisms, how likely is the organism to survive (based on some DNA bases frequency), creating and array of 30 organisms that will survive and transformating their DNA sequence based on equal DNA particles. All of this using methods object methods.
